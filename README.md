## Media Gallery module

> This module is no longer supported. Basically I never liked it much! The idea is sound, but I didn't like the Flash implementation or the UI. 

The Media Gallery module is a simple Flash script that lets you display your form's media content (currently only images) in an gallery, providing a more convenient way to browse that information rather than manually clicking on each submission and viewing the images separately. When configured, the module displays a single icon on the Submission Listing page for all admin and client accounts, letting the user toggle between the default table-formatted content and the Flash Media Gallery.
